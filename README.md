# rippled-signing

This is essentially a combination of the Ripple Javascript code for binary-codec and signing to enable local signing of XRP Ledger WebSocket API JSON.

e.g. To locally sign a transaction to transfer money.


Best place to start on documentation is: https://developers.ripple.com/serialization.html

Main use case is just signing transaction, but should handle more although not tested as much.
